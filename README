This distribution allows application developers to create software and games that use the Fove HMD.
It is a work in progress and while we will do our best to not introduce breaking changes, sometimes this is inevitable in the software lifetime development cycle.
Documentation is available on the wiki at https://github.com/FoveHMD/SDK/wiki and is also a work in progress.
